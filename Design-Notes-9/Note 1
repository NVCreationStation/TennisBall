Why does the robot has to lift the basket and push it down?
Why does the robot has to be in "U" shape?
Will we need two motors if we have to use a basket to collect tennis balls? Can we use pneumatics to push the basket mounts down or lift the
basket mounts up?
If we use pneumatics will it consume lot of power? What does the circuit look like? Will it cost more?
Can we use just one motor to collect balls similar to a rotor with wider blades in the front to collect balls?
